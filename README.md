**The Big Question: What can we do to target deforestation?**.

Deforestation represents one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time, with far-reaching impacts on climate regulation, biodiversity, and indigenous communities. Globally, forests are being cleared at an alarming rate, with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations reporting an estimated 10 million hectares of forest lost annually between 2015 and 2020 (Greene, 2020). This loss not only contributes to the rise in greenhouse gas emissions but also erodes the natural habitats of countless species. The aim of this report is to uncover trends and insights that will inform targeted strategies to mitigate forest loss. This is driven by the imperative to understand the dominant drivers behind this global deforestation, which is essential for crafting effective interventions and policies to halt and reverse this trend.

In pursuit of this understanding, we will analyse data sets that capture the extent of forest loss across countries and the activities responsible for this decline. The analysis will particularly examine the rates and reasons for forest loss, such as agricultural expansion, logging, and urban development. To elucidate the findings, we will create a colour mapping plot to find out which country has the highest deforestation area.
